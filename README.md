This repository is a part of study project The Joint development of E-Learning Services for Interdisciplinary Computing Studies” (JESICS+) proposes to implement an E-Learning platform, as a core curriculum specialized in interdisciplinary computing studies (ICS). The curriculum instantiates novel content and structures in higher-education and teaching at the partner institution in Egypt. The platform implementation is achieved through transferring the Learning Management System “Stud.IP” in cooperation with expert advisors of the VirtUOS center at the partner institution in Germany, based on bundling the involved partners’ recognized expertise and international resources in computer science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, university teaching &amp; research, and educational digital learning and technology. This paves the way for accreditation of novel curricula in ICS in the Egyptian higher education community.
